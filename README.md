## application name :
Beneficence Application
### project idea :
Our idea is a platform that serves two groups of society. One is the donor and the other is the charity where the latecomer needed to hand over to the poor. The donor will basically need to fill out a simple form to describe and attach a photo of the item being donated. The charity can then choose what is best for them and the needy individual or family. In general, this platform will facilitate the transition between the two parties and save the required space and storage cost on the charity.
